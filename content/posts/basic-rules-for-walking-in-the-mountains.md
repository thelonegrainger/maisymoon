excerpt: It was going to be Maisy's first big birthday party with all her
  friends invited, but that plan got corona'd. In spite of that, Maisy's loved
  ones still showed up for her!

The highlight of the party (besides the cake, or rather the frosting) was a bunch of birthday wishes compiled in a video for Maisy, which ended up being almost 30 minutes long! So much love for one special three year old. Happy three Maisy Moon!
